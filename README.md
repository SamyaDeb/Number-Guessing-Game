🎮 Number Guessing Game in C
This is a simple and fun terminal-based number guessing game written in the C programming language. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user must guess the number through repeated input attempts. After each guess, the program provides a hint — whether the actual number is higher or lower than the guessed number — until the correct number is guessed.

The game also tracks the number of attempts made and displays the total once the correct number is guessed.
